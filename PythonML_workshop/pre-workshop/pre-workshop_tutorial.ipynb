    "We hope this super-basic introduction has given you a glimpse at some of the basic functionality of Python. Of course, Python is way more powerful than what has been shown here. We call this _pre-workshop_ because once you know the basic data types, how to define variables, and do some simple math on them, we are going to need to jump into new concepts â€” for loops and conditional statements, as well as invoke new libraries (like numpy and matplotlib) to make further progress. If you're ready to do that, head on over to the workshop! "
