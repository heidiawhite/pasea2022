        "Neural networks (NN), also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. The concept of neural networks lies at the intersection of mathetics and computational programming. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another to process input and recognize patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of **node layers**, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial \"neuron\", connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.\n",

        "Simply put: neural networks are effectively computer programs created to recognize patterns and solve common problems in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. \n",
